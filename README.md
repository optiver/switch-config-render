# switch-config-render

switch-config-render is a python module that can be used to create
an SVG depiction of the internal configuration of an FPGA-based network
switch product.

The module renders:
* Front panel interfaces in use, together with their optional alias and
description
* FPGA application interfaces with their optional alias and description
* Applications configured on the FPGA devices and the ports that they
are connected to
* Cross-connect connections between the front panel and application
interfaces which can be colour-coded depending on the connection type(s)
as defined in the interface definitions

Example output:

Install by running `python setup.py install` from the project root
directory.

## Generating an SVG

The SVG can be generated by calling the `generate_system_svg` function:

```python
generate_system_svg('svg_file.svg', interfaces, connections, fpga_devices, device_shapes)
```

Where:
* `svg_file.svg` is the name of the destination .svg file
* `interfaces` is a dict specifying all the front panel and FPGA application
interfaces
* `connections` is a dict of `key: value` pairs, where the `key` defines the
destination and the `value` the source of a connection
* `fpga_devices` is a dict that specifies the application devices that are
configured on the given FPGA
* `device_shapes` defines the vertices of the shapes to be used for the
application device defined in `fpga_devices`

Refer to the example code in `switch_config_render.__main__.py` for more
information.

## Example Application

An example application is provided and can be run by calling:

```bash
python -m switch_config_render
```

from the project root. The example runs `switch_config_render.__main__.py`
which runs two examples: one that calls the high-level
`generate_system_svg` function and one low-level example that manually
creates objects for fine-grained placement control. These examples
produce the `high_level_example.svg` and `low_level_example.svg` files
respectively.
